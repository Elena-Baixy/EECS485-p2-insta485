EECS 485 Project 2 insta485
===========================

## Introduction
An Instagram clone implemented with server-side dynamic pages. This is the second of an EECS 485 three project sequence: a static site generator from templates, server-side dynamic pages, and client-side dynamic pages.

Build an interactive website using server-side dynamic pages. Reuse the templates from project 1, rendering them on-demand when a user loads a page. New features include creating, updating, and deleting users, posts, comments, and likes.

## Goal
The learning goals of this project include server-side dynamic pages, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), sessions, and basic SQL database usage.
